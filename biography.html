    </section>

    <section class="life-stage">
      <h3>The Wandering (730-733)</h3>

      <h3>The End Scene</h3>
      <p>In the final chapter of his life, he handed his last poem to a friend. It was titled <strong>"The End Scene"</strong>:</p>
      <div class="poem">
        <p>The mighty roc takes wing and soars,<br>
        Through all the realms, his strength endures.<br>
        He shakes the heavens with his might,<br>
        And in the wind, his spirit takes flight.</p>
        <p>To the East he journeys on and on,<br>
        With my sleeve grasped tight, he is gone.<br>
        Let future generations hear my tale,<br>
        Of Confucius' passing, let none be pale.</p>
        <p>For though he's gone, his legacy will live,<br>
        Through those inspired, his spirit will give.<br>
        Who will grieve and weep for my death,<br>
        When all that's left is my final breath?</p>
